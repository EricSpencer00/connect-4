(* A function to check if a player has won.
   This would be a complex function to write, involving checking all
   horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines. For this example, we'll
   use a placeholder. *)

(* A theorem stating that if a player has won, they are the winner.
   This seems trivial, but in a complex system, such proofs ensure
   that different parts of the code agree on the definition of winning. *)
Theorem winner_is_winner : forall (b: Board) (p: Player),
  check_win b p = true -> exists winner, winner = p.
Proof.
  intros b p H.
  exists p.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(* We can also define the 'move' function and prove properties about it,
   such as a move in a full column is invalid, or a move correctly
   places a piece at the lowest empty spot. *)
